# Propagation Project - LELEC2910
This git repository contains all the code and the report of the project of propagation in LELEC2910. 
The course was given to master students in electrical engineering at Ecole Polytechnique de Louvain (Belgium).

This repo showcases the work of Louis Delait - ELEC2M 

I invite you to read the report before taking a look at the simulation code, this is just there to show how I threated data.

Happy reading :)
