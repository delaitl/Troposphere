# Propagation Project - LELEC2910


Simulations of the impact of the troposphere on communications with LEO satellites. 
More precisely, it aims to determine the effect of the troposhere on wireless transmissions with LEO satellites at 77 GHz and then to compute a link budget of the transmission.
All of this in order to know the needed power on board of the satellite for transmission.


This git repository contains all the code and the report of the project of propagation in LELEC2910. 
The course was given to master students in electrical engineering at Ecole Polytechnique de Louvain (Belgium).

This repo showcases the work of Louis Delait - ELEC2M 

I invite you to read the report before taking a look at the simulation code, this is just there to show how I processed data.

Happy reading :) 

Louis
